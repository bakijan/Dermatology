Multiclass classification of erythemato-squamous diseases from clinical and histopathological attributes
In this notebook, I conducted multiclass classification analysis of erythemato-squamous diseases from 12 clinical and 
22 histopathological attributes using modern machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) , Extra-Trees
Classifier , Random Forest Classifier , XGBoost , and Keras . SVM, extra-trees classifier, and random forest classifiers 
are implemented using sklearn. XGBoost model is built using Python API. Keras is running on Tensorflow.
